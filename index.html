                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Wong Yuk Hong, currently studying MSc Information Technology 
                in Hong Kong Polytechnic University. This year (2022) is my final year of the study. 
                However, My undergraduate degree is BSc Environmental Science graduated from the Chinese University 
                of Hong Kong in 2018.</p>
                <p>In my final year of undergraduate study, I enrolled the course about statistical programming,
                 from which I have learnt R and SAS programming for statistical analysis, arousing my interest 
                 in learning computer technology. Thus, I study this MSc to explore various aspects of IT instead of 
                 solely Data Science.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I enrolled two Practical Japanese courses to learn some basic Japanese in University.
                Though the final grades are C+ and C-, I am glad to have such chance to learn other languages. After graduation, 
                I self-studied elementary Japanese language and sat for JLPT N3 test in July 2021. Finally I passed the N3 test, though 
                the score is not that high I have expected.</p>
